[Matt Sparks](http://quadpoint.org) received his first dose of artificial light
in a hospital in Marion, Illinois in early
[1986](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986). He lived in Marion until age five,
when he made the journey to his so-called hometown of Charleston, Illinois
(home of [EIU](http://www.eiu.edu)). Matt spent his elementary years in
Charleston. Partly into the freshman year at
[Charleston High School](http://www.charleston.k12.il.us/CHS), he moved to the
Springfield, Illinois area. Matt finished off his high school career in Chatham
at [Glenwood High School](http://ghsonline.net) with the class of 2004.

In December 2008, he completed his B.S. in
[Computer Science](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu) in the
[College of Engineering](http://www.engr.uiuc.edu) at the
[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.uiuc.edu) (UIUC).

Matt now has a master's degree in [Computer Science](http://cs.stanford.edu)
from [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu), completed in June 2011.
