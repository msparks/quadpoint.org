= Supercooled Water =

(//December 8, 2005//) Yesterday morning I went to get some bottled water
from my garage. It had been in the garage for over a week, mostly
undisturbed. The outside temperature was reportedly -17C (about 1F);
I imagine the garage was slightly warmer than that, but still below the
freezing point of water. I picked up a bottle of water and noticed that it was
**not** frozen. In fact, it was completely liquid. But soon after I disturbed
it, the water in the bottle began to crystalize. The water became progressively
cloudy from the top down as it froze inside the bottle. The effect was much
like the ice creeping along the walls and floors in
[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/|The Day After Tomorrow]].

Unfortunately, I was unable to capture the action yesterday. With hopes of
reproducing the phenomenon, I thawed a few of the bottles and put them out
again last night. This morning it was slightly warmer (about -7C), but I
was pleased to find that several of the bottles of water were still in the
liquid state. I managed to capture three videos of reasonable quality of the
water turning to ice.


== Videos ==

These videos were recorded with a Canon Powershot S50 digital camera. They have
not be altered in any way, other than to reencode them to xvid from mjpeg to
reduce size (//edit: and then uploaded to YouTube, 2006-12-15//). I assure you
that the liquid you see in them is truly water with nothing added to it. It is
straight from the bottle. The bottled water I happened to have was [[wp>Nestle Pure Life]] Purified Water.

**Video 1**: This shows an open bottle, about half full, being shaken. The
water solidifies in a matter of seconds.

**Video 2**: Water in a clear glass is stirred with a straw and freezes. (This
is the most impressive video, in my opinion)

**Video 3**: I tried to pour some water from a bottle into a glass, but ice
formed at the mouth of the bottle before I could get much out. This video
(almost) shows the crystalizing in the bottle. Keep your eyes on the bottom of
the bottle; you can see it get cloudy as the water changes states.

== Conclusion ==

Well, if you're impressed, you're probably normal. Yesterday, when I first saw
it happen, I picked up three or four more bottles, just watching it crystalize
inside the bottle.

Wikipedia has an article on
[[wp>supercooling]], and
[[http://www.digibio.com/archive/RedHerring_com-Why_water_is_weird.htm|this article]] also has a mention of the supercooling of water. In order for water to
be supercooled, it needs to be in a very clean and "smooth" container and it
needs to be quite pure:

``Water typically won't freeze without some impurities around which its
molecules can begin to coalesce. For this reason, researchers who study
supercooled water do so with the purest water they can get.'' (source:
[[http://www.digibio.com/archive/RedHerring_com-Why_water_is_weird.htm|Why Water Is Weird]])

So, with smooth clean plastic as the container for pure bottled water sitting
undisturbed in a cold garage, the conditions were just right for the
supercooling effect to occur. It is indeed quite the spectacular sight.
