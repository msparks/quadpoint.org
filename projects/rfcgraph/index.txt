{{{rfcgraph}}} is a simple [[wp>Python]] script that uses [[wp>Graphviz]] to generate a very large graph showing the relationships between [[wp>RFC|RFCs]].

The full version is in PDF format with clickable nodes, and is available here:
[[http://static.quadpoint.org/rfcgraph/rfcs.pdf]]

* Green arrows indicate an update: "RFCx --green-> RFCy" is read as "RFCx is updated by RFCy"
* Red arrows indicates an obsoletion: "RFCx --red-> RFCy" is read as "RFCx is obsoleted by RFCy"

== Downloading ==

The source code used to generate the graph can be obtained via {{{git}}}:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/msparks/rfcgraph.git
}}}

You can also view [[http://github.com/msparks/rfcgraph/|rfcgraph on github]].

=== Dependencies ===

* [[http://www.python.org|Python]]
* [[http://www.graphviz.org|Graphviz]]
* [[http://dkbza.org/pydot.html|pydot]]

== Running ==

To run {{{rfcgraph}}}, you'll need to get a copy of the RFC index XML file
({{{rfc-index.xml}}}) from [[http://rfc-editor.org/getbulk.html|rfc-editor.org]]. Then run:

{{{
./rfcgraph.py -h
}}}

to see the usage.

Note that rfcgraph and graphviz are very memory intensive. On the order of 2-2.5GB of RAM is needed to generate the full graph.
