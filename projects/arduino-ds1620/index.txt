This project is a library for the [[http://arduino.cc|Arduino]] platform. It
provides a simple interface to the
[[http://www.maxim-ic.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/2735|Maxim DS1620]] digital
thermometer.

== Downloading ==

The code is hosted by [[http://github.com|GitHub]] at [[http://github.com/msparks/arduino-ds1620|msparks/arduino-ds1620]].

It can be cloned with:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/msparks/arduino-ds1620.git DS1620
}}}

The code is also available in
[[http://github.com/msparks/arduino-ds1620/tarball/master|tarball]]
and
[[http://github.com/msparks/arduino-ds1620/zipball/master|zipball]]
forms.

== Installing ==

Placing the {{{DS1620}}} directory in a new {{{libraries}}} directory within
the directory containing sketches seems to work for me. Newer Arduino IDE
versions pick up libraries from here. Specifically, the {{{DS1620}}} directory
is located at:

{{{
~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/DS1620
}}}

on my Mac.

A simple
[[https://github.com/msparks/arduino-ds1620/blob/master/examples/ds1620/ds1620.pde|example]]
that prints out temperatures is included with the code.
