= libgithub: a JavaScript library for displaying GitHub data =

libgithub uses the [[http://develop.github.com|GitHub API]] to display
interesting activity from your [[http://github.com|GitHub]] account. Currently,
the library can create commit badges, like the one shown below. However,
libgithub is intended as a framework to easily display GitHub information on
your websites and blogs.

libgithub v1.0 was released February 12, 2010.

== Demo ==

{{{
noescape: true
raw: true

<script type="text/javascript">
$(window).load(function () {
  (new libgithub.Badge('msparks', 'libgithub')).targetIs('#commit');
});
</script>
<div id="commit"></div>
}}}

This badge was generated with:

{{{
lang: html
<script type="text/javascript">
$(window).load(function () {
  (new libgithub.Badge('msparks', 'libgithub')).targetIs('#commit');
});
</script>
<div id="commit"></div>
}}}
