**Project status: Completed, 2006**

I created this [[wp>Wireless_Markup_Language|WML]] interface as an undergrad at
[[http://www.uiuc.edu|UIUC]]. It existed as a Perl script running on a server,
accessible from my cell phone. The script listed a few common bus stops that I
used most frequently, and when one was selected, the stop information was
obtained from the
[[http://www.cumtd.com|Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District]] and displayed
on the phone. It was mighty useful on cold winter days.

The phone pictured is an LG VX4400.
