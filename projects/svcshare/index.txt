svcshare is a distributed queueing system. It was created to facilitate
exclusive access to a shared resource by a number of nodes. The collection of
nodes communicate with one another over a common broadcast medium. A node
broadcasts the size of its own queue as well as its usage of the shared resource
common to all nodes in the cluster.
