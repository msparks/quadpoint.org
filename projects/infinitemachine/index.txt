= Infinite Machine =

Infinite Machine, or infmx, is the custom web engine that powers
[[http://quadpoint.org|quadpoint.org]]. I started this project because I
couldn't find a similar project that would do what I wanted how I wanted. It is
written in Python and uses the [[http://www.django.com|Django web framework]].

== Features ==

[[projects/infinitemachine|Infinite Machine]] has features similar to other
wikis, namely [[http://wikipedia.org|Wikipedia]] and
[[http://www.dokuwiki.org|DokuWiki]]. Here are some of the major features that
have been implemented.

=== Wiki syntax ===

The primary component of Infinite Machine is a wiki parser. A key feature I
wanted in my website software is the ability to write content in wiki-like
syntax instead of HTML. I settled on the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|Creole]]
specification, and Infinite Machine uses the parser from
[[http://code.google.com/p/python-creole/|python-creole]].

See the [[projects/infinitemachine/syntax|syntax]] page for examples.

=== Git storage backend ===

Document content and resources for documents, such as document-specific images,
are read directly from a [[http://git.or.cz|git]] repository. This has wonderful
side effects and avoids reinventing the wheel for content management. Publishing
can be as easy as pushing to a repository.

=== Aggressive caching ===

Efficiency is an important element in Infinite Machine's design. Fetching, parsing and
rendering pages is costly, often taking several hundred milliseconds for a
single page request. Therefore, caching is essential.
[[http://www.danga.com/memcached/|Memcached]] is used to reduce the request time
to a few milliseconds.

=== Syntax highlighting ===

When source code is included in a document, it is easy to add syntax
highlighting in infmx. The [[http://pygments.org/|Pygments]] library is used to
highlight code snippets like this:

{{{
lang:c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  printf("syntax highlighting is awesome\n");
  return 0;
}
}}}

=== Structure extraction ===

In true wiki spirit, Infinite Machine extracts the document title, summary, and
headers to be displayed individually by a template. The summary is considered
to be everything between the title header and the second level header. The table
of contents is automatically generated from the header information and is
displayed after the summary, as shown at the top of this page.

== Downloading ==

Infinite Machine is an open source project. It is hosted on
[[http://github.com|GitHub]] at [[http://github.com/msparks/infinitemachine]].

It can be cloned with:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/msparks/infinitemachine.git
}}}

No fancy documentation is available yet. Infinite Machine is still new and may not
be ready for general use, but feel free to submit bugs and patches.
