= Infinite Machine =

Infinite Machine, or infmx, is the custom software that generates
[[http://quadpoint.org|quadpoint.org]]. I started this project because I
couldn't find a similar project that would do what I wanted how I wanted.
Infinite Machine generates static content (.html files) from templates and
specially-formatted documents written in a wiki-like syntax.

Infinite Machine was originally a Django application that generated pages on the
fly. It had a number of caching mechanisms in place to keep up performance, and
a feature called Infinite Caching was implemented to update the cache
asynchronously, allowing for virtually infinite cache times.

Then I realized this was silly and unnecessary.

In summer 2010, Infinite Machine was reimplemented to use the same interface as
[[http://jekyllrb.com|Jekyll]].

== Features ==

[[projects/infinitemachine|Infinite Machine]] has features similar to other
wikis, namely [[http://wikipedia.org|Wikipedia]] and
[[http://www.dokuwiki.org|DokuWiki]]. Here are some of the major features that
have been implemented.

=== Wiki syntax ===

The primary component of Infinite Machine is a wiki parser. A key feature I
wanted in my website software is the ability to write content in wiki-like
syntax instead of HTML. I settled on the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|Creole]]
specification, and Infinite Machine uses the parser from
[[http://code.google.com/p/python-creole/|python-creole]].

See the [[projects/infinitemachine/syntax|syntax]] page for examples.

=== Syntax highlighting ===

When source code is included in a document, it is easy to add syntax
highlighting in infmx. The [[http://pygments.org/|Pygments]] library is used to
highlight code snippets like this:

{{{
lang:c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  printf("syntax highlighting is awesome\n");
  return 0;
}
}}}

=== Structure extraction ===

In true wiki spirit, Infinite Machine extracts the document title, summary, and
headers to be displayed individually by a template. The summary is considered
to be everything between the title header and the second level header. The table
of contents is automatically generated from the header information and is
displayed after the summary, as shown at the top of this page.

== Downloading ==

Infinite Machine is an open source project. It is hosted on
[[http://github.com|GitHub]] at
[[http://github.com/msparks/infinitemachine|msparks/infinitemachine]].

It can be cloned with:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/msparks/infinitemachine.git
}}}

No fancy documentation is available yet. Infinite Machine is still new and may
not be ready for general use, but feel free to submit bugs and patches.
