= Pastee =

[[https://pastee.org|Pastee]] is yet another [[wp>pastebin]]. I didn't like some of the
design decisions of the popular pastebins, so in 2008, I started my own.

Pastee came to fruition during the Yahoo! [[http://www.hackday.org|Hack Day]] at
[[http://www.uiuc.edu|UIUC]] in September 2008. It won the //Best Overall// award.

As of April 2009, it's still not open source. I haven't touched the code much
since Hack Day. However, in the coming months, it will be made open and hosted
on [[http://github.com|GitHub]] at
[[http://github.com/msparks/pastee|msparks/pastee]].

Until then, you can use the unfinished, slightly buggy live version at
[[https://pastee.org|pastee.org]].
