In unixland, user preferences for common programs like [[http://vim.org|vim]], [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/|emacs]], [[http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/|screen]], [[http://zsh.org|zsh]], etc. are stored in files typically named as './/foo//' or './/foo//rc' in the user's [[wp>home directory]]. I use several different computer systems on a daily basis, so to keep my settings consistent, I keep my configuration files in a [[wp>git]] repository to easily manage updates.

My **dotfiles** repository is public. It contains my {{{.zshrc}}},
{{{.muttrc}}}, {{{.vimrc}}} (and {{{.vim}}}), among others. To clone (checkout in [[http://subversion.tigris.org|subversion]] terms), you'll need to install [[http://git.or.cz/|git]] and execute the following:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/msparks/dotfiles.git
}}}

This will create a {{{dotfiles}}} directory in the current directory. Of course,
since the files all begin with a period, you will need to use {{{ls -a}}} to list them.

Updates to my dotfiles repository can be fetched using {{{git pull}}} within the
{{{dotfiles}}} directory:

{{{
cd dotfiles
git pull
}}}
